# Performance Classification Project

## Aim

The primary aim of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately classify individuals into different performance classes (A, B, C, or D) based on their physical attributes and performance metrics\. By achieving this goal, we can gain insights into factors that contribute to performance levels and potentially identify areas for improvement\.

## Objective

The specific objective of this project is to create and evaluate multiple machine learning models capable of predicting an individual's performance class\. These performance classes are categorized as follows:
- **Class A:** Represents the highest performance level\.
- **Class B:** Indicates above-average performance\.
- **Class C:** Corresponds to average performance\.
- **Class D:** Represents the lowest performance level\.

## About the Dataset

The dataset provided contains information on various physical attributes and performance metrics for a group of individuals\. Let's break down the columns:

1\. **Age (age):** This column captures the age of each individual, ranging from 20 to 64 years\.
2\. **Gender (gender):** The gender of each individual is categorized as 'F' (female) or 'M' (male)\.
3\. **Height (height_cm):** Height is measured in centimeters\. To convert it to feet, divide by 30\.48\.
4\. **Weight (weight_kg):** Weight is recorded in kilograms\.
5\. **Body Fat Percentage (body fat_%):** This column represents the percentage of body fat for each individual\.
6\. **Diastolic Blood Pressure (diastolic):** The minimum diastolic blood pressure value\.
7\. **Systolic Blood Pressure (systolic):** The minimum systolic blood pressure value\.
8\. **Grip Force (gripForce):** Grip strength measurement\.
9\. **Sit and Bend Forward Measurement (sit and bend forward_cm):** Indicates an individual's flexibility, specifically how far they can bend forward while sitting\.
10\. **Sit-ups Count (sit-ups counts):** The number of sit-ups performed by each individual\.
11\. **Broad Jump Distance (broad jump_cm):** The distance an individual can jump in a broad jump\.
12\. **Performance Class (class):** This column assigns each individual to one of the performance classes (A, B, C, or D)\. The dataset is stratified, ensuring proportional representation of each class\.
